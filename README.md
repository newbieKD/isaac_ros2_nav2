# Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab, ROS2, and Nav2 Integration

## Introduction

This project integrates Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab, ROS2 (Humble), and Nav2 to facilitate reinforcement learning training and path planning for humanoid robots. It provides a Docker containerized environment for ease of setup and deployment.

## Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   NVIDIA Container Toolkit
*   RealVNC Viewer (optional, for remote GUI access)

## Installation
